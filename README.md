## Installation and running
The installation process is super simple, no need for a database or external software other than Visual Studio.<br/>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsikshteinberger/Autodidact
```
After installation you can run through Visual Studio or just open the [executable file](https://github.com/itsikshteinberger/Autodidact/blob/master/Courses%20Notes/Courses%20Notes/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/Courses%20Notes.exe).<br/><br/>
__Notes__<br/>
* The app does not close you access to courses after the end date or before the start date, the app as a whole is designed to help you arrange all the courses within one software.
* The link can also be a local path from your local machine - not necessarily a link from the internet.
